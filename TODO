-Supplemental "slow" search that does a search over package information fields, as opposed to the quick xapian-based search
-Config GUI for: Policy on untrusted packages, confirmation dialogs (save on quit)
-Optional columns for installed and available versions in the Muon Package Manager
-Commercial app support. (See: software-center/db/update.py, backends/restfulclient.py)


New updater GUI:
- Split updates in to categories:
  - "System Libraries" (better name?)
  - Source packages
  - Security updates
- Do not give package counts in notifications or category headers
- Do give download size amounts, since that is interesting to users.
- Give each category a details extender, where a list of affected packages can be found
- List updates by source package. A user doesn't need to see that ktorrent, ktorrent-data
  and plasma-widget-ktorrent are being updated unless he cares enough to check the details
