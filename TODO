-Make a generic class housing a PackageView/DetailsWidget combo that ManagerWidget and ReviewWidget can subclass
-Improve sort performance
-Make a DownloadModel class that has a column with a progress bar for reporting the progress of individual downloads
-Make a subclassable MuonMainWindow that has all the actions set up, as well as all the connections to the backend set up. That way making an update program or an app install program will not mean rewriting the shell
