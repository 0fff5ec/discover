From the Oneiric UDS Muon sprint:
-Don't show label when we don't know download speed or time
-Implement size hint for HistoryView


New updater GUI:
- Split available updates in to categories:
  - "System Libraries" (better name?)
  - Source packages (generally applications)
  - Security updates
- Do not give package counts in notifications or category headers
- Do give download size amounts, since that is interesting to users.
- Give each category a details extender, where a list of affected packages can be found
- List updates by source package. A user doesn't need to see that ktorrent, ktorrent-data
  and plasma-widget-ktorrent are being updated unless he cares enough to check the details
